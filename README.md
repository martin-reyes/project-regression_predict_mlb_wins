# Project 1: Predicting MLB Team Wins + Analyzing Stats' Relations to Team Wins

**Description:**
- In this project, **team pitching stats** and **team batting stats** are used to see which stats lead to more wins. After finding the features that predict wins the most, regression models will be made to predict team wins in a season.

**Goals:**

- EDA: 
    - gain insights on stats the are important for wins
    - visualize insights
- Modeling:
    - build a machine learning (ML) regression model that can predict team wins in a season based on the team stats from that year
    - evaluate the best regression model for insights
- Features: MLB stats that are not calculated off wins or runs
- Target: team wins (continuous target)


### Acquire Data

[See Data Dictionary](#data-dictionary)

- Used Selenium to read mlb team and player stats from [Baseball Reference](https://www.baseball-reference.com)


### Data Analysis (EDA)

Data is split into training and test data. Analysis is performed on training data to avoid bias and data leakage during modeling. 

Test data is separated to test ML regression models later in the project.

**Which features correlate most to wins?**

**Note:** Only analyzed stats that are not calculated off wins (`W`) or runs (`R`), which will have an obvious bias towards wins.

Insights:

- Pitching stats that predict wins: `OPS`, `WHIP`, `FIP`
- Offensive stats that predict wins: `OPS+`, `TotA`, `rOBA`, and hard hits (`HardH%`)
- Pulling more hits leads to more wins than hitting to the opposite field.
- Pitching stats overall correlate more to wins than offensive stats

**1. Teams that pull the ball win more than those that don't.**

**2. OPS/OPS+ lead to more wins**

### Machine Learning Models: Regression

Baseline Model:

- `sklearn`'s `DummyRegressor`, which makes a constant prediction equal to the average team wins in a season.
- Model predictions are off by about 13 wins, on average, and explain none of the variance.

Best Regression Model: Linear Regression

- Model predictions are off by about 6 wins, on average, and explain 77% of the variance.

| Model              | $R^2$   |  RMSE     |
| :----------------- | -------- | -------- |
| Baseline           |  0.0     |  12.8    |
| Linear Regression  |  0.77    |  6.2     |

- $R^2$ (R-squared): proportion of variance in wins explained by the model
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):  average prediction error of the model


|           |   Scaled Coeffs   |	Unscaled Coeffs  |
| --------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
|OPS+	    | 26.89        |           0.54 |
|HR_bat	    | 16.30    	|           0.075 |
|BatAge	    | 8.28	        |           1.02 |
|WHIP	    | -25.76     	|         -53.01 |
|HR_pit	    | -23.64	    |          -0.11 |
|PAge	    | 1.90	        |           0.24 |
|Intercept	| 79.47     	|          79.47 |


The model's scaled coefficients tell us which features impact the model's predictions most. These can be thought of as wins added for having the maximum number of that feature rather than the minimum. So if the maximum number of home runs hit in a season is 200 and the minimum is 100, the model adds 26.89 more wins for a team if they have 200 home runs rather than 100.

The model's unscaled coefficients tell us how many wins are added or subtracted for number of units:

|     |   Wins Added per Unit |    Unit   |
|-----|-----------------------|-----------|
|OPS+ |           5.4         |  10 points |
|HRs hit |        .75         |      10 HRs |
|Batters age |      1.02      |      1 yr |
|WHIP  |          -5.5        |  .10   |
|HRs allowed|    -1.1        |        10 HRs |
|Pitchers age |    .24        |       1 yr      |
|Intercept    |   79.4        |                 |

### Conclusions and Insights

##### Summary

Analysis
- Batting stats that predict wins:
    - `OPS+`, `TotA`, `rOBA`
- Pitching stats that predict wins:
    - `OPS`, `WHIP`, `FIP`
- Pulled hits leads to more wins than not
- Pitching stats correlate more to wins than offensive stats

Modeling
- Baseline model predictions were off by 12.8 (RMSE) wins, on average, and explained 0 ($R^2$) of the variance.
- Best model was a linear regression model. Predictions were off by 6.2 wins, on average, and explained 77% of the variance in wins.

##### Recommendations
- Use the linear regression model to predict team wins from a past season based on their stats to see how 
- Recognize value in advanced and sabermetric stats like `OPS+`, `TotA`, `rOBA`, etc. that predict wins better than traditional stats like `BA`, `HR`, `H`. 
- While it is a unique skill for a hitter to hit the ball in any direction, recognize that this skill may not be as valuable as other skills, like being able to consistently hit the ball hard and draw walks.


##### Next Steps
- Analyze player data. Turn one of the important stats, like `OPS`, into the target variable and see which player stats and features drive this target.
- Investigate runs scored in a season and see if I can predict this number.
- Find groups/categories of players and find value and insights in these groups though clustering.
